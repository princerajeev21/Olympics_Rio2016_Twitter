A Twiiter Sentiment analysis study of recently concluded Olympics  in Rio 2016

So, finally we have come to the conclusion of world's biggest sporting event -Rio Olympics 2016.  It started with a grand opening ceremony on August 4th 2016 and finally came to end with another amazing closing ceremony   on 21st August 2016.  Athletes from almost 206 countries have participated in this great event and was followed by viewers all around the globe.  One unique feature of last few Olympics is that more opinions about athletes and countries are shared by people all over world through the medium of social media.  So obviously everyone will be curious to know what most people are talking over social media.

For the purpose of this study, I have considered tweets about most popular athletes and general category of Rio Olympics 2016 .It was impossible to consider all medal winners and all country athletes. So I have tried to include only the most popular athletes. Tweets are fetched for a particular time period when the athletes were competing.   for mist of athletes  5000-15000 tweets were extracted depending on their popularity. Finally sentiment analysis is performed on the tweets and visualized using Shiny and R.
